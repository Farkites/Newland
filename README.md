# Newland
Final project for Machine Learning Subject in the[Master Degree Program in Data Science and Advanced Analytics](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/mdsaa) in [Nova IMS (Universidade Nova de Lisboa)](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/default). Exact project guidelines can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/newland).

**Only Machine learning models imported from sklearn library were allowed in this project.**


This project was motivated by a fictional mission called “Newland”. After the discovery of a
habitable planet about 120.000 people were sent to populate the new world. With an emerging
economy and a second fleet arriving to the new planet, the Newland government decided that
residents should start paying taxes in order to increase the financial sustainability.

The purpose of this work was to aid the government forecast the impact of tax programs. The
exposed plan consisted in the application of a binary tax plan that depended on the income level
as above or below the average. In consequence, the initial stage of the project consisted in the
development of a predictive model to accurately classify the income of citizens in said two levels.

The provided dataset contained information on several features regarding each citizen’s general
demographic characteristics, including name, birthday, native continent, marital status, current
residency, education data, role, and employment sector. Additionally, it included information
regarding the selection process for the “Newland” mission (Money Received, and Ticket Price).


This project was develop by [Tiago Jose Isidoro Ramos](https://github.com/Exileus) and [myself](https://github.com/Farkites).
